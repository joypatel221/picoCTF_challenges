# MiniRSA

Breaking down a simplified version of RSA – smaller keys, modified encryption. Time to flex those mathematical muscles.

**How I did it:**

1. Poked around the simplified RSA encryption process.

2. Applied mathematical techniques (factoring, brute-forcing) to crack it.

3. Opened the treasure chest – decrypted ciphertext, hello flag!
