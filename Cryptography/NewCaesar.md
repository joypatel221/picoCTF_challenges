# New Caesar

Solving a twist on the classic Caesar cipher â€“ the alphabet is shifting, and I need to find the right shift value.

**How I tackled it:**

1. Studied the ciphertext for patterns and frequencies.

2. Used a cipher tool and my wits to find the shift value.

3. Applied the shift and unveiled the flag.
