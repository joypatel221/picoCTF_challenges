# ARMssembly0

This challenge throws me into the world of ARM assembly programming. I need to write a small program to sum two numbers and print the result.

**How I nailed it:**

1. Got comfy with the basic ARM assembly instructions.

2. Jotted down the assembly code for summing two numbers.

3. Used an assembler to turn my code into machine code.

4. Ran the machine code and grinned at the calculated sum.
