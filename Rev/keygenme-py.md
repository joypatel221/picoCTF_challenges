# Keygenme-py

I'm diving into this challenge where I need to crack a Python script generating encryption keys. The script is like a puzzle, but if I carefully untangle it, I'll find the algorithm behind generating the secret key.

**How I tackled it:**

1. I started by deciphering the Python script. Used tricks like string decoding and pattern matching to make it readable.

2. Once the script was clear, I checked out the key generation algorithm. It's all about creating a random prime number and using it for the secret key.

3. The magic happens when I print the secret key â€“ that's the flag!
