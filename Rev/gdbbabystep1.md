# GDB Baby Step 1

Time to play with GDB, a tool for peeking into C and C++ programs. The challenge wants me to step through a program, tweak a variable, and see the program's reaction.

**How I did it:**

1. Set up GDB and started debugging the provided C program.

2. Put a breakpoint where the variable's value gets printed.

3. Ran the program until it hit the breakpoint.

4. Changed the variable's value to see how it affects the output.

5. Kept running the program to see my modified results.
