# Forbidden Paths

Playing detective in a web server's configuration files. Finding those paths that are supposed to be off-limits but, due to misconfigurations, are open secrets.

**How I did it:**

1. Checked out the web server config file for forbidden paths.

2. Used my web browser to test the suspected forbidden paths.

3. Kept an eye on the server's response to see if I hit the jackpot.
