# Caas

Unleashing my skills on a web app, searching for a vulnerability that lets me execute my own code. The app is a bit too trusting with the data it lets in.

**How I cracked it:**

1. Identified the templating system the web app used.

2. Cooked up a test input to exploit the lack of data cleaning.

3. Injected some naughty code into my test input.

4. Sent it to the web app and watched the magic happen â€“ code execution!
