# Local Authority

This time, it's about exploiting a web app's weakness in handling file uploads. Uploading files that shouldn't be there? I'm all in.

**How I nailed it:**

1. Identified the file upload feature in the web app.

2. Crafted a sneaky file upload request to snatch a local file.

3. Sent the request, crossed my fingers, and voila â€“ local file in my hands!
