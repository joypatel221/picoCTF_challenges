# Trivial FTP

So, there's this challenge where I'm digging into a network traffic capture file to find some hidden info. The file is full of FTP transfers, and the trick is to discover the flag tucked away in one of these transfers.

**How I Solved It:**

1. Fired up a network traffic analyzer to open and check out the capture file.

2. Narrowed down my focus to the FTP transfers by filtering the capture file.

3. Kept an eye out for anything fishy or strange in those FTP transfers.

4. Spotted the special file that holds the flag. It might be bigger or have a different kind of name.

5. Picked out that flagged file from the capture file.

6. Took a good look inside the file to find the flag. It could be hiding in the content, the extra info, or even in the way the file is put together.
