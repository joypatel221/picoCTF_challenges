# MacroHard WeakEdge

Time to play Sherlock with a binary file and expose weaknesses in its encryption algorithm. Macros are supposed to be strong, but not this time.

**How I cracked it:**

1. Dived into the binary with a disassembler.

2. Pored over the encryption algorithm, step by step.

3. Found the chink in the armor â€“ a weakness in the encryption.

4. Exploited it and decrypted the data. Flag in my hands!
