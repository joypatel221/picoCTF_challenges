# Tunn3l v1s10n

Now, I'm exploiting a weakness in a network service – protocol tunneling. It's like wearing a disguise to sneak past security.

**How I did it:**

1. Found the vulnerable network service.

2. Peeked into the service's protocol to see if it's susceptible to tunneling.

3. Crafted a tunneling request, snuck it in, and waited for the magic.

4. Tunnel established, security bypassed – sweet success!
