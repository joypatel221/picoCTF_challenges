Time to channel my inner detective and analyze a network traffic capture file. It's like spying on a conversation about a stock trading scheme.

**How I cracked it:**

1. Fired up a network traffic analyzer to peek into the capture file.

2. Filtered out the noise to focus on the stock chat.

3. Picked apart the conversation, searching for hidden gems.

4. Found the flag in the hidden info â€“ mission accomplished!
