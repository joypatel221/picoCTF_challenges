# Babygame01

Let's have some fun with a guessing game. Clues and hints are my allies; I just need to use them wisely to progress.

**How I aced it:**

1. Read the game's clues and hints like my life depended on it.

2. Analyzed the patterns and relationships hidden in the hints.

3. Made educated guesses based on what I uncovered.

4. Repeat, repeat, repeat until I conquered each level.
