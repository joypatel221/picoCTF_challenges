# Buffer Overflow 0

Time to get a bit naughty – exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a C program. I get to overwrite memory and make the program dance to my tune.

**How I owned it:**

1. Spotted the buffer overflow hole in the C program.

2. Crafted an input that would make the program spill beyond its boundaries.

3. Precisely placed my data in the overflow to hijack the program.

4. Ran the program with my crafted input – watch it dance!
